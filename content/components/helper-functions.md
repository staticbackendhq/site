We want StaticBackend to have a rich set of re-usable common functionalities 
for typical web applications. Now that the core pieces are there, we can bring 
you more value for your applications.

Some of those advanced features are only available from the server-side for 
security reasons. You have multiple options. You can have an effortless 
server-side application between your frontend app and StaticBacken. Or you 
might opt to use an existing function-as-a-service provider that calls 
StaticBackend API.

Here are the functionalities that are available today. Since we're also using 
StaticBackend to build SaaS, we're adding new functions as we encounter the 
need.

**Caching**: You may store objects in a cache. It's handy for external 
integrations to keep state, for instance.

**Send emails**: Your application can now send emails. Proper for all types of 
applications.

If you need something specifics, do not hesitate to let us know.
