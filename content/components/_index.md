At its core, StaticBackend is a backend as a service product. It combines 
high-available infrastructure with backend functionalities to form a complete 
solution.

You can focus entirely on building your application without 
thinking about any backend related aspect.

### You handle the frontend. We take care of the backend.

As soon as we're releasing new features, you automatically get access to the new 
functionalities. The components on the left are what we're currently supporting.

The first component is [user management](/components/users).
