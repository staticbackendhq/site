Building something that needs a feature we don't have yet? Let us know!

StaticBackend is actively developed and we prioritize features our users need. If you're missing a critical component for your use case, we want to hear about it.

### How to request features

**GitHub Discussions** - Share your use case and feature needs:
→ [Join the discussion](https://github.com/staticbackendhq/core/discussions)

**Direct contact** - Need something urgently?
→ [Contact us](/contact) and tell us what you're building

### What we'd love to know

When requesting a feature, it helps to share:

- **What you're building** - Understanding your use case helps us design better features
- **What's missing** - The specific functionality you need
- **How you'd use it** - Example code or workflow helps us nail the API design
- **When you need it** - Timeline helps us prioritize

### We're building in public

StaticBackend is open source, which means:

- ✅ You can see our roadmap and planned features
- ✅ You can contribute features yourself
- ✅ You can vote on what we build next
- ✅ You have transparency into development

### Common requests we're considering

Based on user feedback, here are features we're exploring:

- **Payment processing** - Stripe/PayPal integration
- **Search** - Full-text search across your data
- **Analytics** - Built-in usage tracking and metrics
- **Rate limiting** - API throttling per user/endpoint
- **Workflow automation** - Visual automation builder
- **Webhooks** - Outbound notifications to external services

Vote on these or suggest your own in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/staticbackendhq/core/discussions).

### Self-hosting? Build it yourself

Since StaticBackend is open source, you can extend it yourself:

- Add custom endpoints to the API
- Create new helper functions
- Integrate external services
- Contribute back to the community
