A tiny component that can be useful for your marketing site is capturing form 
data submission.

You can use this feature for contact form, email subscription, waiting list, 
etc. We used this feature on our signup page until we publically allow 
people to create accounts.

You can use our CLI to view the responses to all your forms. You may also 
delete entries from the CLI.
