Welcome! Let's get you up and running with StaticBackend. Choose the path that fits your needs:

## 🚀 Try Managed Hosting (Recommended)

**Best for:** Building and shipping apps fast, AI-assisted development, no DevOps

Get a working backend in **5 minutes**. Perfect for:
- Testing StaticBackend with your project
- Building production apps without managing infrastructure
- Working with AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

**What you get:**
- Instant database, authentication, and file storage
- 30-day free trial (credit card required after trial)
- No setup, no servers to manage
- Deploy anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, your own hosting)

## 💻 Self-Host StaticBackend

**Best for:** Full control, custom deployments, open source enthusiasts

Run StaticBackend on your own infrastructure. Perfect for:
- Projects requiring complete data control
- Custom deployment scenarios
- Contributing to the open source project
- Learning how StaticBackend works internally

**What you need:**
- Docker (easiest) or Go 1.16+
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Redis
- 30 minutes for setup

→ [Self-Hosting Guide](/getting-started/self-hosting)

## 🛠️ Install the CLI

**Best for:** Local development, managing your backend, deploying functions

The CLI lets you:
- Run a local development server (no account needed)
- Manage your backend from the command line
- Deploy server-side functions
- Work offline during development

→ [Install the CLI](/getting-started/cli)

## Need help deciding?

**Start with managed hosting if:**
- You want to build and test quickly
- You're using AI coding assistants
- You don't want to manage servers
- You value automatic updates and scaling

**Choose self-hosting if:**
- You need data in specific regions
- You have existing infrastructure
- You want complete control
- You're comfortable with DevOps

Still unsure? Try managed hosting first—it's the fastest way to see if StaticBackend fits your project. You can always self-host later.
