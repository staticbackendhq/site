I've been building SaaS products for a long time. One aspect I'm personally 
struggling with is finding lots of new paying customers each month.

Customer retention always has been the key to me. When you think about it, a 
15% customer churn rate means you're replacing your entire customer base every 
six months.

It felt like focusing on keeping the hard earn paying customers was the way to 
go while continuing to make sure the leads' pipeline is getting filled with 
quality prospects.

At my last startup, we decided one day to investigate how people were using our 
product. It has been a shocker. We had a hard time believing that most of the 
intuitions we had about how people would use our product proved wrong.

I really enjoy the SaaS market, and I believe a tool that increases customer 
retention will help to grow a business since the efforts of converting paying 
customers will be optimized.

## The problem

The customer retention metric is critical. It goes hand-to-hand with customer 
churn. Improving it affects your monthly recurring revenue, your lifetime value.

It will be hard to increase the retention until you have an excellent knowledge 
of what part of your product sticks or slips.

Most often than not, you don't know why a new user did not convert from their 
trial or why a paying customer cancel.

You can reach out after the fact, but wouldn't it be better to reach out before 
those cancellations happen?

Only checking if a user had signed-in in the last 30 days is not enough to 
prevent canceling. It does not tell you the real truth about what you could do 
to make them return.

Another problem I face with past SaaS was regarding product updates. How can 
you be sure that your last product update truly made a difference?

Did a popular feature still use as much? Had you added too many things that 
your product feels bloated and your trial to paid conversion dropped.

It's hard to stay on top of everything while managing your business. You might 
have some SQL queries here and there. But at some point, they'll not be enough 
to give you the way to improve your customer happiness.

## Our solution

We're planning to launch a series of tools to help your team improve your 
customer retention, thus decreasing your customer churn rate.

Our first tool is in beta at the moment. It helps you analyze your daily usage 
and understand where to focus.

Based on customer feedback, we're going to continue launching tools to make 
sure your effort to get paid customers is maximized and grow your customer base 
instead of renewing it.
