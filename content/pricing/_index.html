	We recommend investigating the fact of

	can offer you a custom plan as well if you'd like to continue using our 
	managed services, please contact us for information.

		<h3>What's a document?</h3>
		<p>		
			We're using a document database. It means that you store documents as JSON 
			objects instead of rows of data like in a relational database system.
		</p>
		<p>
			The best way to model your data is to have documents match what your UI needs 
			to display.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="w-full md:w-1/2">
		<h3>What are reasonable limits?</h3>
		<p>
			We currently don't enforce a hard bandwidth limit. We can decline a good 
			rule of thumb from the number of documents in the plan. For instance, 12k 
			documents would give roughly 1 gigabyte of bandwidth per month.
		</p>
		<p>
			The API calls are throttled per user. A user cannot perform more than 25 
			API calls in 60 seconds.
		</p>

		<h3>What if we exceed the document limit.</h3>
		<p>
			You'll receive an automated email at 90% of your capacity to prepare for 
			upgrading your plan or clean up some documents. If you exceed your limit, 
			we'll contact you to find the right option for you. 
		<p>
			Your users are never impacted. Your account can continue to write and 
			read documents while you upgrade.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="w-full md:w-1/2">
		<h3>You cannot exceed WebSocket connections</h3>
		<p>
			We are having a hard limit on WebSocket connections. You cannot exceed the 
			maximum of concurrent connection your plan allow. You'll receive an HTTP 
			error if you try to connect and your connection pool is full.
		</p>
		<p>
			We recommend you maintain an internal count inside your application so 
			you may notify yourself if you're often approaching your maximum connection.
