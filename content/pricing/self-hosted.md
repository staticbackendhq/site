			Sometimes your product needs the power of dedicated hardware, and as you 
			grow, you might want to have more control 	over your infrastructure.

			get started with via managed services. But when the time comes for a company 
			to take ownership of its infrastructure, it would be possible. We've got 
			your back covered, here's our self-hosted solution.
